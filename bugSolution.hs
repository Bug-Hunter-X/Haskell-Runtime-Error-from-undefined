```haskell
main = do
  let x = 10 -- Or some other default value
  print x

--Alternatively, handle undefined values through pattern matching:

maybeValue :: Maybe Int
maybeValue = Just 5 -- Or Nothing

main' = do
  case maybeValue of
    Just val -> print val
    Nothing -> print "Value is undefined"
```
